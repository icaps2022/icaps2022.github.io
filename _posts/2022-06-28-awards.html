                <h4>Star-Topology Decoupled State-Space Search in AI Planning and Model Checking.</h4>
                <h4><em>Daniel Gnad</h4></em>
                <p>The dissertation introduces “star decoupled search”, a novel way to carry forward state searches more
                  effectively, making use and exploiting conditional independence relations that can be observed in the
                  causal graph of the planning domain. Like partial order reduction techniques, and in particular,
                  symbolic search methods, the idea is to represent sets of states in a suitable factorized manner that
                  can provide exponential savings in both time and space. The dissertation formulates and studies this
                  novel search technique, theoretically and experimentally, and shows how it can be used in combination
                  with other techniques such as partial order reduction, symmetry breaking, and dominance pruning. The
                  effectiveness of star decoupled search is not only demonstrated in the context of planning where a
                  goal state of affairs is to be reached, but also in the setting of model checking for safety and
                  liveness properties. Substantial savings of star decoupled search are shown clearly in both cases.</p>

                <h4>Online Spatio-Temporal Demand Supply Matching.</h4>
                <h4><em>Meghna Lowalekar</em></h4>
                <p>The dissertation develops comprehensive solutions for effective online matching of demand to shared
                  resources such as cars, food, or bikes, while accounting for potential future supply and demand. The
                  contributions include novel algorithms for online matching that can efficiently handle tens of
                  thousands of shared resources and thousands of demand requests per minute, theoretical guarantees on
                  solution quality for single capacity and multi-capacity resources, and extensive empirical evaluation
                  of the approach on real datasets and real systems at scale showing substantial performance gains. The
                  effectiveness of the developed approaches has been demonstrated in real-world settings to match taxis
                  to customers and to match security resources to potential threats and are being adopted for future use
                  in several other application areas.</p>

                <h4>Synthesis of Interpretable and Obfuscatory Behaviors in Human-Aware AI Systems.</h4>
                <h4><em>Anagha Kulkarni</h4></em>
                <p>The dissertation studies behavior synthesis algorithms whose objective is to improve the
                  interpretability of the behavior of an intelligent agent in the presence of a human observer. In
                  addition, it studies how environment redesign strategies can be leveraged to improve the overall
                  interpretability of the agent’s behavior. To this end, it considers comprehensive assumptions about
                  the entities present in the agent’s environment; namely, that such entities are cooperative,
                  adversarial (i.e., attempt to infer information from the agent’s behavior) or a combination of both.
                  In adversarial settings, the agent generates obfuscatory behavior that prevents sensitive information
                  from falling into the hands of the adversarial entities. The dissertation shows that it is possible to
                  synthesize interpretable as well as obfuscatory behaviors using a single underlying algorithmic
                  framework. These results made significant contributions to the rapidly growing area of explainable
                  planning.</p>

                <h4>Symmetry Breaking and Operator Pruning in Classical Planning and Beyond.</h4>
                <h4><em>Alexander Shleyfman</h4></em>
                <p>The dissertation is devoted to the study of graph automorphisms as a tool for symmetry-based search
                  pruning and heuristic enhancements for deterministic forward-search planning. The contributions
                  significantly expand the existing knowledge in this area, including new ways to exploit strictly
                  larger symmetry groups, extensions of A* that reduce search effort and increase the number of problems
                  solved, a study of graph automorphisms for state-space pruning in satisficing planning, comprehensive
                  analysis of the symmetry properties of several popular existing heuristic functions , and how they can
                  be used to enhance heuristic estimates, and an integration of partial order reduction and symmetry
                  elimination for cost-optimal classical planning. The formal analysis of the concepts and algorithms is
                  rigorous, and the empirical analysis shows that substantial computational gains can be achieved,
                  especially in optimal planning.</p>

                <h4>Improved Non-deterministic Planning by Exploiting State Relevance (ICAPS 2012)</h4>
                <h4><em>Christian Muise, Sheila McIlraith, Christopher Beck</h4></em>
                <p>This paper introduced the main techniques that form the foundation of the PRP planner, one of the
                  very best planners for computing plans—particularly conditional plans with loops or policies—for fully
                  observable non-deterministic (FOND) planning problems under stochastic fairness. Thanks to these
                  techniques, PRP had the potential to compute plans in FOND domains up to several orders of magnitude
                  faster than previous approaches. The effectiveness of these techniques encouraged significant follow
                  up research on non-deterministic planning domains. Among others, it gave impetus to the research on
                  relating planning in Artificial Intelligence and automated synthesis in Formal Methods.</p>

                <h4>Temporal Planning with Preferences and Time-Dependent Continuous Costs (ICAPS 2012)</h4>
                <h4><em>J. Benton, Amanda Coles, Andrew Coles</h4></em>
                <p>This highly-cited, seminal paper in the area of temporal planning describes the temporal planning
                  system OPTIC, which allows to express preferences that are not directly coupled with makespan. It uses
                  mixed integer programming to reason about soft and hard constraints and it allows to use continuous
                  functions to express soft constraints. These developments represent significant advances beyond what
                  planning systems at that time were able to support. It is still used as a key reference system in the
                  temporal planning area and it is often used in implemented systems when the need for temporal planning
                  arises.</p>
