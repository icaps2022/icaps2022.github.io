            <h1>Gather Town Instructions</h1>


            <p>The preferred way of attending the conference is our virtual conference center on the Gather platform.</p>

            <p><strong><a href="https://app.gather.town/app/HZHd6ck9wn1jzaFJ/ICAPS22">ICAPS 2022 Gather Space</a></strong></p>

            <p>Everything is accessible from inside gather.town. In particular, you can walk into sessions by entering
              one of the main track rooms, "Track A" and "Track B", just like you usually would.
              You will then be able to open the respective Zoom meeting by pressing "X" and following the instructions.
              The same is true for all other events, like workshops or tutorials.
              The web page accompanies this with overview information as well as details on specific events.</p>

            <p>Workshops and Tutorials also have separate rooms in the gather.town space. Here is an assignment from
              event to room name:</p>

            <table>
            <tr><td><strong>Gather Room</strong></td><td><strong>Event</strong></td></tr>
            <tr><td>Marina Bay Sands</td><td>PRL, XAIP, HSDIP, RDDPS</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Gardens by the Bay</td><td>HPlan, SPARK, FinPlan, IntEx</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Singapore Flyer</td><td>DAPSPAC, KEPS, PlanRob</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Jewel</td><td>All tutorials</td></tr>
            </table>

            <p>The above minimap of the gather space indicates the areas in which the events will take place.
            The start point is in the top middle of the map. If you walk down a bit, there is the main track rooms A and B to your
            left, respectively right. Below that to the left are the rooms for workshops, tutorials, and the DC.
            Further below are the areas where poster booths, demos, and sponsors are displayed.</p>

            <p>In the top left of the space is the access to the bar, where social sessions take place. In the top right is a beautiful garden.
            Right of the workshop rooms is a small caf&eacute; where you can take a break.</p>
