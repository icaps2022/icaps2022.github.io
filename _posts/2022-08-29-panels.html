            <h1 class="top">Industry Panel</h1>

            <p>The Industry & Application Panel will discuss how to increase the impact of ICAPS research on societal
              and industrial problems, and how to let researchers benefit from learning about practical issues. The
              objective of this roundtable is then to find ways to improve the interaction between the ICAPS community
              and the industry along two lines of thought: 1) Getting ICAPS results to industry, and 2) Getting ICAPS
              research more directed by problems that are relevant in practice.</p>

            <p>The panelists are Christina Burt (Fortescue Metals Group), Hoong Chuin Lau
              (Singapore Management University), Andrea Micheli (Fondazione Bruno Kessler),
              Cédric Pralet (ONERA), and Mark Boddy (Adventium Labs).
              Mathijs de Weerdt (TU Delft) and Florent Teichteil-Koenigsbuch (Airbus) will serve as moderators.</p>

              is also lead developer of the pysmt (www.pysmt.org) open-source project aiming at providing a standard
              Python API for satisfiability modulo theory solvers. Andrea coordinates the AIPlan4EU project
              (www.aiplan4eu-project.eu) aiming to remove the access barriers to automated planning technology and to
              bring such technology to the European AI On-Demand Platform. He authored more than 30 papers in the Formal
              Methods and Artificial Intelligence fields.</p>

            <p><strong>Cédric Pralet</strong> works as a researcher at ONERA, the French Aerospace Lab. He graduated
              from an engineering
              school in aeronautics and space in 2003, passed his PhD in Computer Science in 2006, and has been entitled
              to supervise research in 2015. His research interests concern constraint-based optimization and automated
              planning and scheduling applied to problems from the aerospace field, especially for the design and
              operations of satellites.</p>

            <p><strong>Mark Boddy</strong> has been working in industrial research and development for more than 30
              years. He has worked on applications including manufacturing operations, refinery scheduling, avionics for
              commercial aircraft, military operations, and both attack planning and vulnerability analysis for
              cybersecurity.</p>

            <h1 class="top">Career Development Panel</h1>

            <p>A career - whether in industry or academia - is a long journey that is different
              for everyone. The Career Development Panel will discuss which barriers and support the panelists
              encountered at different stages and how they succeeded to grow in their career.
              It will be interesting to everyone who wants to develop their own career or who
              is in a role to support others, e.g. as an advisor or mentor.</p>

            <p>The panelists are Christina Burt (Fortescue Metals Group), Meghna Lowalekar
              (THB), Sarah Keren (Technion) and Sheila McIlraith (University of Toronto). Gabriele Roger (University of
