            <h1>General Instructions</h1>

            <p>ICAPS 2022 can be attended in three different ways:</p>

            <ul>

              <li><strong>Via gather.town (preferred):</strong> You can enter the ICAPS 2022 gather.town virtual conference space using
                this link:<br>
                <a href="https://app.gather.town/app/HZHd6ck9wn1jzaFJ/ICAPS22">https://app.gather.town/app/HZHd6ck9wn1jzaFJ/ICAPS22</a>

                <p>All events will be accessible from within the virtual space.
                Meet your fellows in the gather.town space and interact with other attendants in the virtual space!
                More instructions on how to use the gather.town space can be found <a href="/gather">here</a>.</p></li>

              <li><strong>Joining Zoom meetings directly without gather.town:</strong><br>
                <p>Links for the main sessions, as well as workshops, tutorials, and DC are available <a href="/zoom-meetings">here</a>.</p>

                <p>In the Zoom sessions, you can ask questions directly to the presenters, preferably via audio/video,
                alternatively via text chat.</p></li>

              <li><strong>Watching live streams on <a href="/live-streams">this webpage</a>.</strong>

                <p>All technical and plenary sessions can be watched using these streams.
                However, no interaction will be possible with other attendants.
                Workshops, tutorials, and DC are not available via stream.</p></li>
            </ul>


            <h3>Passwords</h3>
            <p>You will need a password to enter the gather.town space as well as the Zoom meetings and the online
              streams.
              This password has been sent to via email. The same password is valid for all tools that are being used.
            </p>



            <h3>Main conference sessions</h3>

            <p>The technical and plenary sessions will be held via Zoom. Links are available <a href="http://icaps22.icaps-conference.org/zoom-meetings">here</a>.<br>
              The Zoom links are also available within the gather.town space, in the rooms "Track A" and "Track B".
              The sessions will be run by Slideslive, our external partner, and will be moderated by a session chair.
              Slideslive will stream the pre-recorded videos into the Zoom meeting so that everybody watches the talks
              together.</p>

            <p>The preferred way of asking questions is by doing so directly via audio/video in Zoom, please use the
              "raise hand" feature of
              Zoom to ease the life of the session chair.</p>

            <p>Note that all technical sessions and invited talks will be recorded and made available online after the
              conference.</p>

            <h3>For presenters</h3>
            <p>Please be available in both sessions your paper is presented in. After the video has been played, a Q&amp;A
              session will take place.
              This will be moderated by a session chair. We ask you to briefly talk to the session chair in Zoom before
              the session, indicating that you are available.</p>

            <h3>For session chairs:</h3>
            <p>A Slideslive technician will stream all talks into the Zoom meeting. After every talk, there will be 5min
              for Q&amp;A which you should moderate.
              Please ask the technician to start playing the next video once the Q&amp;A is over.</p>



            <h3>Poster / demo sessions</h3>

            <p>Posters and demos are only available in the gather.town space.

              space, e.g. for further discussions or poster sessions.
