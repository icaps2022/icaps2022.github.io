          <h1>Puzzle Game Team Challenge</h1>

            <p>Forget about pub quizzes, here comes the Puzzle Team Challenge! Team-up with your friends and challenge others with hard puzzles.</p>

            <p>The Puzzle Challenge will take place in Zoom, the link is available on the <a href="/zoom-meetings">Zoom page</a>.
            The meeting will also be accessible from the <a href="/gather">Marina Bay Sands room</a> in gather.town.</p>

            <p>There will be a short introduction at the beginning to explain the challenge. We then ask you to move into Zoom breakout sessions
            with the members of your team (you will be able to chose the breakout room yourself). With your team you will then 1. get to know the
            game, 2. create your own puzzle, and 3. play and try to solve the other teams' puzzles. The more puzzles you are able to solve, and the
            fewer teams manage to solve your puzzle, the better you score. Hence, the goal is to design a challenging puzzle and
            try to solve as many other puzzles as possible. Further details will be explained at the beginning of the challenge.</p>

          <h1>Open Discussion</h1>

            <p>There will be two open discussion sessions, which we run in the <a href="/gather">Marina Bay Sands room</a> in gather.town.</p>

            <p>Please see the <a href="/discussion-call">call for topics</a> for further details.</p>

          <h1>Speed-Gathering</h1>

            <p>How about speed-dating in gather.town? Don't worry, we are not attempting to get you paired off.
            But in case you are interested in getting to know new members of the ICAPS community in a fun
            and informal setting, this is the event to participate in. The Speed Gathering will be run as a usual speed dating,
            i.e., you will be paired with another participant on a table and be given a short time to talk to each other. Depending
            on the number of participants, we will allocate a few minutes per pairing. We will run several rounds, so you get to know
            many people during the event. The topics you can talk about are pretty much open to you, but we will make sure to provide
            some fun questions and topics as inspiration.</p>

            <p>The speed-gathering room is placed in <a href="/gather">gather.town</a> and is located at the northern end of the Bar.</p>

          <h1>Games Session</h1>

            <p>Fancy playing some casual games with your colleagues? Join us in one of the games sessions!</p>

            <p>At the entrance of the Games room there is a board providing some useful information. There are many casual games
            placed right in the room. You can simply walk to a table and start playing with your colleagues.
            We also provide further information on how to play several external games that are based on
            the gather.town space. Some round of racing? Or are you rather into escape games? Your choice!</p>

            <p>The games room is placed in <a href="/gather">gather.town</a> and is located at the eastern end of the Bar.</p>

          <h1>Pseudonym Get-Together</h1>

            <p>It's almost a standard social get-together session in the gather.town space. Well.. almost.. please give yourself fun names -- how about Donald Duck? --
            and let's see who you end up talking to.</p>
