  abstract         = {Representing real-world planning problems is a major open subject. Standard planning modeling languages are fully declarative, making it challenging to use them for expressing complex mathematical functions, that are often required for describing the effects of actions. Recent approaches turn to external sources of information, such as simulators or black-box modules, to overcome such modeling limitations. This paper proposes a novel approach to represent and solve planning problems, by starting with partial declarative action models and incrementally refining them during planning by invoking domain-specific external modules. Since these might be computationally expensive, we provide the planner the ability to trade-off modeling uncertainty against computation time, to meet target plan accuracy. Results that were obtained for planning with dynamic estimation of action costs are sketched, and planned work, together with open challenges, are further detailed.},

AMLSI learns with no prior knowledge from a training dataset made up of action sequences built by random walks and by observing state transitions. The domain learnt is accurate enough to be used without human proofreading in a planner even with very highly partial and noisy observations. Thus AMLSI takles a key issue for domain learning that is the ability to plan with the learned domains. It often happens that small learning errors lead to domains that are unusable for planning. AMLSI contribution is to learn domains from partial and noisy observations with sufficient accuracy to allow planners to solve new problems. Also, this paper presents an incremental and a temporal extension.},

Among the many proposals to unify both fields, the one known as neurosymbolic AI has recently attracted great attention. It combines the Deep Neural Networks characteristic of modern RL with the symbolic representations typical of AP. The main goal of this PhD is to progress the state of the art in neurosymbolic AI for SDM. To do so, three different lines of research have been proposed. In the first one, I will perform a study of the literature and summarize my findings into a review. In the second one, I will extend my previous work (Núñez-Molina et al. 2021), which combined Deep Q-Learning with Classical Planning to improve planning performance, with the ability to manage non-determinism and will apply it to a real logistics problem. Finally, in the third line of research, I will develop a method for generating planning problems and leverage it to learn HTN domains without expert traces and to study the properties of planning domains.},

We develop a personalized AI assessment module that lets an AI system execute instruction sequences in simulators and answer the queries about its execution of sequences of actions. Our results show that such a primitive query-response capability is sufficient to efficiently derive a user-interpretable model of the system’s capabilities in fully observable, and deterministic settings.},

These algorithms guarantee to find an optimal policy for the initial state for several optimization objectives without necessarily expanding the entire state space, if provided with a heuristic that provides optimistic state value estimates. While a large and diverse set of such domain-independent heuristic families is available in classical planning, the same cannot be said about probabilistic planning. So far, except for the particular case of occupation measure heuristics for (constrained) Stochastic Shortest Path Problems, most of the attempts at constructing heuristics pursue the very simple approach of using a classical heuristic on the all-outcomes determinization of the planning problem, in which the probabilistic effect of an action can be chosen at will. Because this approach is agnostic to the uncertainty in the underlying problem, these heuristics are often not very informative. In this thesis, we will investigate heuristics for probabilistic planning which are formulated on the underlying probabilistic model directly instead of delegating to a classical heuristic on the determinization. To this end, we mainly focus on abstraction heuristics, in particular Pattern Database heuristics and Merge-and-Shrink heuristics.},

With their application for realtime decision-making in safety critical areas, like, e.g., autonomous driving, it arises the need to gain trust in the applied policies. The ultimate goal to gain this trust is through formal verification of the policy-induced behavior. This is a challenging endeavor as it compounds the state space explosion with the difficulty of analyzing even single NN decision episodes. In our work, we make a contribution to cope with this challenge. We approach safety verification through (overapproximating) abstract reachability analysis. We compute predicate abstractions of the policy-restricted state space; expressing the abstract transition computation as a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) problem, and devise a range of algorithmic enhancements to avoid costly calls to SMT. First empirical results show that our approach can outperform competing approaches. Future work will further enhance the technique and extend it to support probabilistic settings.},

What goals would be formed and how would those goals be realized as actions? We would like to produce agent behavior using these questions as guidance for our work. To this end we investigate how long-term autonomy is influenced by an agent’s identity and how these findings can be used to direct the behavior of artificial agents. For our system la VIDA, first we will create a model for human identity and ultimately integrate it with a Goal-Driven Autonomy (GDA) system at the drive level.},
